## Why?

Building offline-first applications has been the ubiquius dream since the early days of the web. Google started by introducing Google Gears, and later followed the web community by building [Application Cache](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/offline.html).

Application Cache was a great step forward, but had several fundamental flaws that were made famous by [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s epic [Application Cache is a Douchebag](http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag) article and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR-TP6jOSQM). So Jake, [Alex Russell](https://twitter.com/slightlylate) and many others, have been busy working on the next generation of application caching API's which today are know as the [Service Worker Specification](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker).

Service Worker is great, but if you ever had a look at it's API(s) you realize that they are complicated imperative JavaScript API's. These API's tend to scare many web developers who prefer a nice forgiving declarative approach.

So in order to **fix** the **too** complicated Service Worker API, we are super excited to introduce **JakeCache**. A declarative manifest-driven application cache for web applications implemented on top of ServiceWorker.

### Polyfill

JakeCache serves the additional purpose of being as compatible with the HTML5 Application Cache (aka AppCache) as we could make it and may serve as a polyfill in browsers removing such support.

Patches are welcome!

## Installation

```bash
npm install jakecache --save
```

## Get started

1. Create a new JakeCache Manifest, `app.manifest` and save it in your root together with the `jakecache.js` file:
```
CACHE MANIFEST
# 2010-06-18:v2

# Explicitly cached 'master entries'.
CACHE:
/test.html

# Resources that require the user to be online.
NETWORK:
*
```

1. Include ``jakecache.js`` on your page, maybe via ```<script src="jakecache.js"></script>```
2. Add ```<html manifest="app.manifest">``` to your HTML.
3. That's it! Your website is now Jake-enabled!
